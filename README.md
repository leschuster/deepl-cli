# DeepL-CLI (unofficial)

This application leverages the power of [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com) to provide seamless translations directly from your terminal.

## âœ¨ Features

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Requirements**:

When you first launch the application, you will be asked to enter an [API Key](https://www.deepl.com/en/pro#developer). DeepL provides both free and paid API keys.

This key will be saved in your system's keyring. If you're on macOS or Windows, everything should work out of the box. On Linux, make sure that [GNOME Keyring](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeKeyring) is installed.

2. **Installation**:

Go to the releases section and download the appropriate binary for your system.

Alternatively, make sure that you have at least Golang 1.23.0 installed and run the following command:

```bash
go install github.com/leschuster/deepl-cli
```

3. **Usage**:

Run `deepl-cli` in your terminal.
